        <h2>what is navigation</h2>
        <p>Navigation is when you have an object which is trying to go from point A to point B. The object "navigates" A->B.<br>
        The way I think about it is there are three kinds of navigation:<br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning"> dead reckoning,</a>what I'll call "inference", and what I'll call "homing."<br>
        Inference comprises two methods: you either track an object optically, or the object is using optics to look at its environment.<br>
        I call this "inference" because the location and orientation of a device is inferred based on external tracking methods.<br>
        Then there's homing, where a device has the signature of a target and it is trying to find it. This goes into weapons stuff so we'll ignore it.</p>

        <h2>problem</h2>
        <p> Infernece dominates. Specifically, optical methods of inference. One of the most popular is the use of IR  to track photoreflective surfaces on a device,<br>
        which you can observe in AR/VR, and surgical navigation</p>
        <p>The issue then, is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law">Inverse Square Law</a></p>

        <h2>other stuff</h2>
        <p> I'm open to talking about a wide range of issues.<br> On the corporate side, I like finding new synergies for IPR and collaboration.</p>
        <p> At Onesys we develop Tools for Healing People, sometimes we manage to be the first to invent.<br>In those cases, our preference is long-term partnership with grown ups in other industries.<br> If you're working on navigation in VR or robotics, we might have something that interests you.<br> For an idea of what I mean, see US5413573A. </p>
