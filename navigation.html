        <h2>what is navigation</h2>
        <p>Navigation is when you have an object which is trying to go from point A to point B. The object "navigates" A->B.<br>
        The way I think about it is there are three kinds of navigation:<br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning"> dead reckoning,</a>what I'll call "inference", and what I'll call "homing."<br>
        Inference comprises two methods: you either track an object optically, or the object is using optics to look at its environment.<br>
        I call this "inference" because the location and orientation of a device is inferred based on external tracking methods.<br>
        Then there's homing, where a device has the signature of a target and it is trying to find it. This goes into weapons stuff so we'll ignore it.</p>

        <h2>problem</h2>
        <p> Infernece dominates. Specifically, optical methods of inference. One of the most popular is the use of IR  to track photoreflective surfaces on a device,<br>
        which you can observe in AR/VR, and surgical navigation</p>
        <p>The issue then, is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law">Inverse Square Law</a></p>, which simply means that as we increase the distance between the thing doing the tracking and the thing being tracked, if the performance of an optical tracking system decreases by an order of magnitude.
