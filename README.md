The point of this repo is to create a kind of homepage. It should be minimalist, simple, it should load super fast and it should be able to act as a kind of "whitepaper dot com" for future lab results and such.
It'll primarily focus on Onesys properties, but might have more personal things as well, or things which do not fall under direct purview of Onesys.

For the time being I'm purely using this to learn basic html, css, and maybe more down the line.

We'll see how it goes.
